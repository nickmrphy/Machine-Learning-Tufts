Name: Nick Murphy
Time: This assignment took me about 12 hours total. I spent 4 hours doing parts 1 and 2.1, 
      but I struggled a lot with part 2.2, which took me about 6 hours. 
      Upon reaching part 3, I saw that I had an unnecessary line in my test_polynomials function that           resulted in my program running indefinetely on the set of higher degree polynomials. It took 
      me a little to find this but upon fixing it the rest of my programming was smooth.
      I asked multiple questions on piazza (about part 2.2) that helped me a lot in completing this             assignment. 
      I also referred to w3schools, stackoverflow, and various library documentations to
      fix my semantics mistakes as I am still getting used to programming in Python and Jupyter
      Notebooks.
