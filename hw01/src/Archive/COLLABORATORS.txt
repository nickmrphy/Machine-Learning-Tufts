Name: Nick Murphy
This is my first time using python so I spent multiple hours learning the
semantics and how to use numpy. I estimate I spent about 2 hours doing this,
then 2 hours doing problem 1 and 3 hours doing problem 2. 
I referred to w3schools and various stack overflow posts in order to get a grasp
on Python, as well as understanding environments and Spyder (the platform I am
using to do python assignments in this class)
